<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">The calm captain of our family ship. Hardworking, soft-spoken, and the ultimate dad goals! He’s so gentle, he could reprimand me and I’d still feel like I’m winning an award for best child.<u>Definitely the best father and imam ever</u>.</td>

<td bgcolor="#FFF5EE">The queen of wisdom and love—but with a strict mom flair! She’s full of advice (useful ones, I promise), <u>always loving, and somehow manages to be kind while keeping everyone in check.</u></td>

<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">The big sis who’s both a comedian and a strict teacher. She’s my role model—super smart, always knows what to say, and the best sister ever. <u>But don’t mess up your schoolwork; she’s got a zero tolerance policy on that.</u></td>

<td bgcolor="#FFF5EE">Think of Along but in the big brother version—funny when he wants to be but brainy all the time. He’s so smart, <u>he’s basically a walking encyclopedia that cracks jokes.</u></td>

<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><u>The silent guardian of the family</u>. Very quiet, very strict, and gives off that cool and mysterious vibe. Probably knows everything but just doesn’t feel like telling us.</td>

<td bgcolor="#FFF5EE">Uhhh... a work in progress? I’d say I’m soft-hearted, adaptable, and always up for learning new things. But if I had to sum myself up: <u>The main character energy </u>(at least in my head).</td>

<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">The little sister with two modes: <u>funny clown or serious professor</u>. Somehow manages to balance being clever and being one of the coolest siblings ever.</td>

<td bgcolor="#FFF5EE">Our favorite bundle of energy—she’s the baby of the family but <u>acts like the boss sometimes</u>. Funny, talkative, and never seems to run out of energy. Basically, our family’s very own live comedy show.</td>

<tr align="center" valign="middle">

<td bgcolor="#FFF5EE">Abah’s been the Cleanliness Boss at Majlis Perbandaran Taiping for over 30+ years. He’s basically a legend there—keeping Taiping clean one step at a time!</td>

<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Mama is a full-time housewife and a full-time superhero. She beat breast cancer like a champ, and now she’s back to being the CEO of our home—Alhamdulillah!</td>

<td bgcolor="#FFF5EE">Along’s a government-certified brainiac—working as a lecturer at Politeknik Metro Tasek Gelugor. She’s strict about education but still cracks jokes when the mood is right!</td>

<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Abang Afiq’s just like Along but maybe with a bit more serious mode activated. Education field? Check. Lecturer? Check. Super intelligent? Double-check!</td>

<td bgcolor="#FFF5EE">Aus turned his passion into a paycheck! He’s now running a workshop with his bestie after graduating. Self-employed, self-reliant—he’s basically the boss of fixing stuff.</td>

<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Currently surviving the diploma life! Juggling assignments, dreams, and naps with style.</th>

<td bgcolor="#FFF5EE">Adik is a high school student at SMK Raja Permaisuri Bainun, where she’s balancing books and her serious but funny personality like a pro.</td>

<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">The ultimate baby of the house! Nana’s 4 years old, spreading laughter and chaos while studying very seriously at Little Caliphs Kindergarten.</td>
